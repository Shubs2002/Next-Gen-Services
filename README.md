# Next Gen Financial Frontend

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript starter scaffold inspired by the Luzia Framer template for a financial services client (loans: car, home, etc.).

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Available scripts:
- npm run dev — start dev server
- npm run build — build for production
- npm run preview — preview production build
- npm run test — run unit tests (Vitest)

Replace placeholder assets and copy content from the design as needed.
